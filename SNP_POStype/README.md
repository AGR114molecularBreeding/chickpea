This code serves as an illustration of our SNP analysis, enriching the dataset with information extracted from a GFF file of the reference genome.
We describe the SNP with additional information, including the affected gene, the strand, and the specific genomic region where each SNP is located within the affected gene.

In this example, we focus on a subset of SNPs derived from a pair of NILs showing differential flowering times in Cicer arietinum (chickpea). 
The Cicer arietinum GFF was obtained from the NCBI RefSeq assembly GCF_000331145.1.
