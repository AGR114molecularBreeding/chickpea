This code snippet serves as an illustration of our data analysis process utilizing the [GEO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) database (NCBI). 
The files slated for processing can be found under the id. [GSE147831](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE147831).  
  
  In this example, we will select a subset of tissues from the initial matrix (FPKM), convert the data into TPM, and identify genes exhibiting the most 
  significant differences in TPM values through pairwise tissue comparisons.
